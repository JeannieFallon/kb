# Python

> Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.
> Some of Python's notable features:
> - Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.
> - Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.
> - Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.
